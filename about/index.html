                        I use a lot of different words to describe myself: engineer, student, roboticist, designer,
                        nerd. But underneath all of them is the same thing, I'm an empath.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m deeply attuned to how people experience the world around them. That sensitivity, shaped by
                        my own lived experiences, is what drives me to learn, to design, and to build.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether I’m working on a robot, a software system, or a physical product, I care just as much
                        about who it’s for as how it works.

            <p>Outside of engineering, I also enjoy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learning about urban planning, public transport systems, and mixed use infrastructure</li>
                <li>Reading, mostly science fiction and fantasy</li>
                <li>Sewing (some of) my own clothing</li>
                <li>Some amateur photography</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Oh yes, and I'm a very big cat person. If you're also a cat person, you may be interested in</p>

            <h2>What is Design Engineering?</h2>
            <p>
                This is though, because it means a lot of different things to a lot of different people, and there's
                some intentional ambiguity built in as well. At its core, DE is built around the idea that real problems
                don't fit neatly into a single discipline. It combines:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A strong foundation in engineering fundamentals</li>
                <li>Flexible technical electives, tailored to personal interests</li>
                <li>Project-based design studios that tie theory to real problems</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>My focus area is in <strong>Robotics and Automation</strong>.</p>
            <p>
                I've balanced my coursework across mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science.
                This reflects the reality that effective robotic systems demand all three.
            </p>
            <p>
                This interdisciplinary approach has given me a big picture understanding of how complex systems are
                designed, built, and integrated from hardware and control to software and user interaction. All of this
                comes together in the design studios. Through open-ended projects, I've been able to apply my technical
                skills while also engaging with systems modeling, stakeholder needs, and real-world constraints.
            </p>
            <p>
                For me, Design Engineering is about more than just making things work, it's about making them work for
                the people who will actually be using them.
