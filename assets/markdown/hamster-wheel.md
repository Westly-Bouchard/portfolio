## Context

This project ultimately failed to meet its functional goals, but it became one 
of the most instructive engineering experiences I’ve had.

For our final design sprint in _Physical Prototyping_ we were asked to develop
a systems integration prototype. Having completed 75% of a prototyping course,
feeling confident in our abilities, and against the caution of our professor, my 
group decided on the monumental task of constructing a human sized hamster
wheel in a little under four weeks.

Suffice it to say, things did not go as planned.

## Hit The Ground Running

Our tight timeline meant that we needed to work fast to have any hope of 
finishing by the due date. To make things worse, our class only met twice a
week.

The pace was frantic: we drew up a basic design on day 1, got parts on order on
day 2, and started manufacturing on day 3. Our design consisted of the following
elements:
- The wheel itself. A four piece modular design with latching connections and
  yoga mats to provide a non-slip walking surface.
- The Base. A two piece base with rollers to allow the wheel to spin.

- Power Generation. A belt driven stepper motor with rectifier and LED based
  voltage display.
- Information Panel. A short explainer with graphics about energy conversion.

Our vision was that this could be set up in a museum or educational environment
to teach people about energy and power generation.

We worked fast, we worked outside of class meeting times, we took work home. We
were doing everything we could to stay on schedule.

## Retroactive Calculations

About two weeks into the sprint, after we had bought and prepared all of our
material, we ran face-first into a massive problem: the floor slats weren't 
strong enough.

We had just assumed that 3/8-th inch plywood would work but, in our haste, and
after a couple of on the fly design changes, it became clear that the wood
would break under load. Some quick calculations confirmed this and about $200 in
materials went down the drain.

This was a wake-up call for us, and we spent the rest of the day retroactively
validating our design decisions, buying new material, and redoing all the prep
work we had done before.

## Falling Short

The project had been going fairly well since our floor thickness mishap. Sure
we were stressed and overworked, but things were moving forward.

Unfortunately, our earlier recalibration led to another round of unforeseen 
problems. But this time, with the other members of my team out for Thanksgiving
break, we simply didn't have the manpower to address them all.

In order to make the wheel strong enough to support a person, we had to switch
from plywood to 2x4s for the walking slats. This almost doubled the weight of
each wheel section, and the combined load on the base bound the bearings that
were supposed to help it roll.

It worked well in the half-wheel tests, but we only got the full system assembled
the night before we had to present our results. At around midnight we had to 
throw in the towel.

## Reflections

The issues described here were only some of the ones we had to deal with 
throughout this project. This project, more than any other, taught me to actually
take feedback I was given, and to take things like timelines and technical debt
seriously.

I think every student needs a failure as monumental as this because there's
just simply no other way to convey the importance of so many of the lessons that
our classes attempt to teach us every day.
