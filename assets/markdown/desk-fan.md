## Context

For our final project in my *Intro to Design Engineering* class, we were tasked
to redesign an everyday object. Our goal was to identify a problem relating to
**usability and user experience**, develop a solution through **rapid 
prototyping**, and to engage in **validation testing** with our peers.

## Problem Identification

We quickly settled on a desk fan as our everyday object as they're fairly
ubiquitous among first year Mines students, especially since some dorms don't
have air conditioning. We identified the following problems relating to
usability and user experience:
- **Noise**: All fans make noise, but the problem is worse for cheaper models 
  that college students usually buy. We identified the primary cause of noise as
  the fan blades.
- **Ease of maintenance**: Fans don't just move air, they also move and collect 
  all the dust in that air. We found that many models were incredibly difficult
  or even impossible to disassemble and clean.

## Initial Prototyping

While conducting research, we found that propeller geometry significantly 
impacts the noise generated. In a paper from MIT's Lincoln Laboratory, we found
that a toroidal propeller geometry had proven to significantly reduce propeller
noise from a drone. We settled on this geometry for our design.

As part of our research, we disassembled a desk fan from Amazon. We found that
the two halves of the blade enclosure were permanently sealed together, making
disassembly a destructive process. We hypothesized that the typical enclosure 
geometry would work well with a snap closure or magnetic latch. We decided
to move forward with the magnetic latch as we felt that it would be better for
the user experience.

Finally, we felt that improving airflow through the blade guard could help
reduce noise, and improve aesthetics. While not a primary concern, we decided
to include airflow in our design parameters as well. We found that a hexagonal
tiling was optimal for the surface area to line coverage ratio so we settled
on this geometry for our design (though others were explored).

Throughout this process, we were sketching our ideas, and this sprint ended with
the construction of a low fidelity prototype out of cardboard and paper.

## Iteration and Data Collection

Our primary usability and user experience concerns with our design were:
- Making the disassembly process intuitive
- Ensuring that the size of our hexagonal tiles prevented the user from sticking 
  their fingers too far in and hitting the blades.

To test these concerns, and validate our design decisions, we developed a series
of mid-fidelity prototypes and engaged in user experience testing with our
classmates.

## Final Design

Our final design was created in OnShape and my job was to create the blade guard
/ housing while my teammate handled the stand. I leveraged OnShape's feature
scripts to efficiently tile a complex surface with a hexagon pattern.

I also designed a simple twist lock closure that used magnets to hold the pieces
in their locked position. Finally, as hexagons were a prominent design element,
we modeled the base after a bee hive to complete the look.
