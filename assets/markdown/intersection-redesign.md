## Motivation

I live near a large, 7 lane arterial road in Denver called Federal Boulevard. A
road I frequently interact with both in a car, and as a pedestrian while taking 
transit to school campus. Over the past few years, I've become intimately
familiar with the dangers and inefficiencies this road provides.

I have always been interested in transportation infrastructure. So when my first
project in _Physical Prototyping_ tasked me to redesign an intersection, I
jumped at the opportunity to explore some solutions to problems that I face 
every day.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column; gap: 1rem;">

<p>I chose this intersection: 1st & Federal, as I frequently cross there after taking the bus.</p>
</div>

My primary goal with this project was to improve pedestrian safety. At the same
time, I wanted to improve the on-time-performance of public transit along the
corridor.

## Bus Rapid Transit

Federal hosts the second-busiest bus line in Denver, the 31, second only to the
15 along Colfax. This means that there is significant pedestrian traffic and,
in combination with the wide lanes and high speeds provided to cars, this gives
Federal another name: the most dangerous street in Denver.

While the ideal solution here would be to completely separate the pedestrian and
public transit corridor from the cars, it is much more feasible to dedicate one
of the existing lanes for bus traffic only. This is typically called Bus Rapid
Transit, as it can dramatically improve speed and on-time-performance of bus
routes.

Interestingly, a month or two after I finished this project, I discovered that
a BRT proposal had been approved by the city for Federal, slated to be completed
in 2030. So, I guess I was on to something...

## To Slip or not to Slip

My other major concern with this intersection was the East-West crossing on
the South side. 1st comes into a T-junction with a major thoroughfare and so
both turning directions are controlled with lights.

Most drivers miss this, however, and make their right turns when traffic stops,
completely ignoring the light and any pedestrians who are crossing as well.
Importantly, pedestrians get the walk before right turning drivers get their
green, and so a pedestrian can start crossing believing it's safe only to be
hit by a right turning driver who wasn't paying attention.

I have lost count of the number of times I've almost been hit by a negligent
driver while crossing the street here.

This led me to a counterintuitive solution. Slip lanes are typically discouraged
in pedestrian-focused design because they encourage higher vehicle speeds.
Under the right conditions, however, they can reduce risk by simplifying 
decision-making for both drivers and pedestrians. Proper light control and 
a raised crossing for pedestrians can mitigate some danger, and the benefits are
twofold:
- Pedestrians only have to worry about cars in one lane, rather than worrying
  about a driver turning into any one of the three lanes they are trying to
  cross.
- Pedestrians are more visible to drivers, as they directly cross in front of
  the vehicle instead of on the driver's passenger side.

## Reflections

More than anything, this project taught me about compromise. There exists an
optimal design that maximizes pedestrian safety, but implementing those changes
would simply not have been feasible for a government so unacquainted with
pedestrian focused infrastructure.

This project reshaped how I think about infrastructure design. Rather than aiming
for an idealized end state, I learned to value incremental changes that balance
political, financial, and construction realities without losing sight of safety
and equity.
