                        I feel strongly the emotions of my peers and this, along with my own lived experiences, is what
                        motivates me to learn, to design, and to build the things that I do.

            <h1>What is Design Engineering?</h1>
            <p>
                "Design Engineering" means a lot of different things to a lot of different people, even within my own
                degree program, and that ambiguity is intentional.
            </p>
            <p>
                At Mines, DE is built around the idea that real problems don't fit neatly into a single discipline. The
                program combines a rigorous foundation in engineering fundamentals with a flexible selection of
                technical electives and a sequence of project-based design studios. Rather than prescribing a narrow
                path, DE allows students to shape an education around their interests while continuously applying what
                they learn.
            </p>
            <p>
                My focus is in robotics and automation. I've deliberately balanced my coursework across
                MechE, EE, and CS because effective robotic systems demand all three. This interdisciplinary approach
                has given me a big picture understanding of how complex systems are designed, built, and integrated from
                hardware and control to software and user interaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                The design studios bring all of this together. Through open-ended, real world projects, I've been able
                to test my technical skills while also engaging with systems modeling, stakeholder needs, and the
                broader context surrounding a design. For me, design engineering isn't just about making things work,
                it's about making them work <em>for people</em>.
